Dotfile CVS Readme

1.0 Introduction

This is a CVS controlled directory for dotfiles in my home directory.

1.1 Reasons

It is inconvienent to checkout files directly into a home directory,
and it is also inconvienent to constantly copy files between a
checkout location and ~/.  As a results, this symlinking tool was
created to make symbolic links from the dotfiles directory into a home
directory.

1.2 Installation:

The installation script is called 'install.py' and must be run so that
its working directory is the checkout directory.
